* **Responsive Video Grids:** Clean, 4-column layouts that automatically adjust for mobile and tablet devices.

== Getting Started & Details ==

### How to Add Videos
Adding content is simple. The plugin uses the **YouTube Video ID** (the 11-character string at the end of a YouTube URL). 
* *Example:* For `youtube.com/watch?v=9K4uBRkFJEU`, the ID is `9K4uBRkFJEU`.
* Simply enter this ID in the Video editor, and the plugin fetches the rest.

### Built-in Layouts
If you use the **Optional Setup Assistant**, it will create two ready-to-use pages for you:
1.  **YouTube Video Gallery:** Features a main player with thumbnail navigation at the bottom.
2.  **YouTube Video Grid:** A high-resolution 4-column responsive layout.

### Customization Tips
* **Thumbnail Quality:** You can change dimensions (e.g., 4:3 instead of 16:9) in the settings to match your site's design.
* **Content & Excerpts:** Add custom text for every video. The content appears on the single video page, while the excerpt appears right below the main video in the gallery view.
